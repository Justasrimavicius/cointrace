This is going to be a crypto information project based on coinranking API.
Link to the API: https://developers.coinranking.com/api/.
Not sure what this API is fully capable yet, therefore cant tell what exactly this project will be able to do - will try to implement various features that a real crypto website would have.
Will use React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend(will be minimal backend integration - mainly focused on API and React use).
